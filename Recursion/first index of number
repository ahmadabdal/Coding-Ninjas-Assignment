First Index Of a Number in an Array - Question

Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0

Solution:

public class Solution {

	public static int firstIndex(int input[], int x) {
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
	 	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
		*/
		
	    //method overloading
        return firstIndex(input,x,0);		

    }
    private static int firstIndex(int input[],int x,int startIndex){
        if(startIndex==input.length)
            return -1;
        if(input[startIndex]==x)
            return startIndex;
        return firstIndex(input,x,startIndex+1);
        }
}
