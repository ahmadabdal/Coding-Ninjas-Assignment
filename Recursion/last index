Last Index Of a Number in an Array - Question

Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.
You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Solution:


public class Solution {

	public static int lastIndex(int input[], int x) {
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
	 	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
		*/
	  return lastIndex(input,x,input.length-1);
    }
    private static int lastIndex(int input[],int x,int startIndex){
        if(startIndex<0)
            return -1;
        if(input[startIndex]==x)
            return startIndex;
        return lastIndex(input,x,startIndex-1);
        }

}
