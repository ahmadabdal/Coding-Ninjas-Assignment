Intersection of Two Arrays 
Send Feedback
You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem
can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Solution:

public class Solution{  
    
    public static void intersections(int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
         int i = 0;   
        
	while(i<arr1.length){
        int temp=arr1[i];
        // boolean ans = false ;
          for(int j=0;j<arr2.length;j++){ 
            if(temp == arr2[j]){
                System.out.print(arr1[i]+" ");
				 arr2[j]=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                break;
            }
          }
        i++;
    }
    }
}
