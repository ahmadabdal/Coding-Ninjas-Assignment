Count Words

For a given input string(str), find and return the total number of words present in it.
It is assumed that two words will have only a single space in between. Also, there wouldn't be any leading and trailing spaces in the given input string.

Solution:


public class Solution {

	public static int countWords(String str) {	
		//Your code goes here
        if(str.length() == 0)
            return 0;
	
     int count=0;
     for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++)
     {
         if(str.charAt(i)==' '){
             count++;
         }
     }
        return count+1;
	}

}
