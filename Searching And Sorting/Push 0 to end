Push Zeros to end
Send Feedback
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You have been required to push all the zeros that are present 
in the array/list to the end of it. Also, make sure to maintain the
relative order of the non-zero elements.

Solution:
public class Solution {  

    public static void pushZerosAtEnd(int[] arr) {
    	//Your code goes here
        	int i=0,k=0;
        int n=0;
        while(i<arr.length){
            if(arr[i]!=0){
               n= arr[i];
               arr[i]=arr[k];
               arr[k]=n; 
               k++;
            }
            i++;
        }
    }
}
